        <h3>The Dark Web</h3>
            <p>I have heard about the Dark Web but have never used anything like Tor. I think it came to my knowledge when I was younger and interested in torrents. The users on forums I would visit would be obsessed with becoming as anonymous as possible. I do not doubt that the Dark Web will continue to grow, but I can't imagine it becoming 'mainstream'. If I just think about what the non tech focused people in my life or around me, almost everything they do is tied to real world identity (social networks, status updates, posting and commenting on pictures, facial recognition on posted pictures that tie photos they didn't take or upload back to their profile).</p>
            <p>For instance, he mentions that Facebook is joining the Dark Web. Are they encrypting the data they recieve in a way that they don't have access to or insight into?</p>
            <p><a href="https://qz.com/667880/a-million-people-now-access-facebook-on-the-dark-web-every-month/">One Million Dark Web Facebook users</a><br />This article written in April 2016, talks about the Million+ users who connect to Facebook's onion site. But there is no mention about how an individual's data is actually protected. Is the main point that the obfuscation performed over using TOR is enough? And that users will just forgo the usual Facebook habits that could identify them? I can't imagine my Dad, or my Sister going through the trouble, but activists and extremists, sure.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Conflict of Interests</h4>
            <p>On the topic of just basic privacy concerns. I can relate with the uneasy feeling that there are multiple profiles of us floating around out there and eventually they'll all just be complied together and we'll have a "Permanent Record", essentially that could be sold to anyone.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The most common argument used to wash that worry away can be summed up as:<br /><em>&nbsp; "What do I care? They just want to show you ads. Its all about getting the right ad to you, they don't want to waste your time or theirs"</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That seems harmless enough, it's all about ads. But what is limiting the data collection to products we browse, product reviews, repair tips (if you need to repair something, there is a chance you're in the market for a brand new one). At what point does serving better ads, just turn into manipulation, confirmation bias and a profit motivated echo chamber. My Step Father's laptop was crushed to death from the weight of malware and spyware installed most likely from ads. Does he know how to protect and repair his system, no. Should he? Everyone should, within reason. But that doesn't stop legitimate websites from serving you Malware because they are unable to vet their ads or keep their systems secure. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/">Forbes asks users to turn off ad blockers - then gives users malware</a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Browsers with privacy in mind</h4>
            <p>For anyone interested there is a relatively new browser out called <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>.<br />The goal of the browser is to increase user privacy and limit tracking. The far off goal is to get rid of most ads by changing the way the content creators get paid. You can essentially set up a wallet, and pay websites for access and the websites will not track you or show you any ads or pop ups. This is a much healthier relationship I feel. I use brave anytime I want to go to a content site (YouTube, Reddit, any news website) where the ads can get out of hand. There are still ads, but the aggressive ads are greatly reduced.</p>
