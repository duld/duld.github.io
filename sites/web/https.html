            <p>I really like HTTPS. If only for the reason that it limits how much information my ISP has on my browsing habits. I am strongly opposed to paying a subscription fee only to be tracked. Google will track your searches, but we don't pay them a fee to use Search. The ISP we pay don't really want to be an ISP, they don't want to be the transport layer that other people's content travels over. They want to sell you content, they're cable companies that begrudgingly sell internet access. I could rant about this stuff for hours. But I will refrain =).</p>

            <p>What I would like to say is that because of how HTTPS works, your ISP can only really see the domain name of the site you're visiting and not the sub domain. That means, they can see you went to Amazon, but they don't know what you're shopping for. This is useful because it, makes it difficult for an ISP to know their customer's shopping habits, sell that data to advertisers and then inject the highly focused advertising onto the web content you're viewing. Hah! This is just turning into a rant!</p>

            <p>One common argument that she mentioned and I've heard before is that HTTPS and HTTP/2 is slow(er in some cases) because of the extra handshaking and encryption. But the best response I've heard is that, processor cycles are cheap and they're only getting cheaper. Not to mention quicker. Its not a problem with today's processors and certainly wont be an issue moving forward.</p>

            <p>There are criticisms however that look like they might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2#Criticisms">valid</a>. And it has to do with securing content that doesn't need to be secure and the cost associated with purchasing certificates every year (shorter certificates are generally more favorable for security). I really don't know enough about that aspect. And Let's Encrypt doesn't seem to be the magic bullet. If they keep issuing questionable certificates, their certificates will lose all credibility with browser vendors.</p>
