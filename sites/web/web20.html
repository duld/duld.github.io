            <p><strong><em>the use of XML, using xml to exchange data</em></strong></p>
            <p>XML - Extensible Markup Language. A markup language that looks like HTML except XML only describes data. XML is extensible while HTML is not. By "extensible", I mean that you can write your own XML tags and it will be not break an XML parser. One of the selling features of XML is that it is both, human and machine readable. Similar to how we can write HTML documents and the computer does not need to compile our HTML into another format to be understood.&nbsp;XML was the king when it came to handling data on the web and even in some desktop applications but now a days JSON is becoming more popular as far as I can tell. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862310/json-and-xml-comparison">XML vs JSON</a>. Both JSON and XML solve the same problems but in different ways.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><strong>Who will organize all of this data? We will.</strong></em></p>
            <p>Based on the visuals of the video, I believe the creator is highlighting the ability to tag content. Tagged content is easier to index and search for. Instead of writing a search algorithm to scan the text of every document you can just search for the matching meta-data tags. I personally like the break down of tagging put forth by this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idioplatform.com/blog/content-tagging-content-personalization/">article</a>. I first encountered tags from reading blogs such as <a href="https://www.pydanny.com/">pydanny</a>. If you scan the right side of the blog you will find a "Tags" section. The Tags section will show all topic keywords that the author tagged. If you click on any of the tags you wil be brought to a page on the blog that has, in order all articles that were tagged that value.</p>
            <p>I think the most popular example of tagging these days are twitter's #tag implementation. Same idea, instead of searching for text content you filter by matching meta-data.</p>
            <p>Going forward it is very likely that more and more tagging will take place through automated methods. For instance If i were to search for "turtle" on google images. Many of the image results are of different types of turtles, but when I inspect the <a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/animals/Reptiles/A-G/green-sea-turtle-closeup-underwater.adapt.945.1.jpg">image itself</a> I can't find any reference to turtles outside of the url string. Even when I download the file and inspect it, I am unable to locate any meta data associated with the file itself. Google was able to figure out that this was a picture of a turtle probably from reading the url and maybe doing a little image analysis (maybe).</p>
