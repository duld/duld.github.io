            <p>Pretty interesting.I had heard of Unicode from using Python but never really looked too much into it. I didn't know that UTF-8 &nbsp;along with UTF-16, UTF-32 etc, was an encoding of Unicode. That's what the "U" in UTF-* stands for, "Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit". The is an interesting blog post about Unicode and JavaScript over at the blog of <a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode">Mathias Bynens</a></p>
            <p>Some Definitions of words that I needed</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Grapheme</strong>: characters or pieces of characters that you might write on a page to make words, sentences, or other pieces of text</li>
            <li><strong>Code Point:&nbsp;</strong>A number that maps to a particular abstract character. Code points make it so that we have a number pointing to a character without worrying about implementation details of how those numbers are stored for the computer to read. Encodings define how the code points map to particular sequence of bytes on disk and in memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqPTR_v4qFA">Introduction to UTF-8 and Unicode</a></p>
            <p>I really like videos that cover more technical topics to have slides incorporated. Sometimes people like to bash slides, but I love having a visual point of reference. One slight note, around 6 minutes 39 seconds, into the video he shows a 4 byte character but he leaves out the heading byte and doesn't end all four character bytes with 10 as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description">UTF-8 Wikipedia description</a>. So don't take his example as correct. If he didn't clear up some of what was said in the Current Topic video I wouldn't be linking this video. Most of what he says is accurate just not his encoding.</p>
            <p>On a side note.</p>
            <p>Was it just me or did the Cameraman's erratic movement drive anyone else insane?&nbsp;What is he doing!? zoom in, zoom out, camera 2 is mostly stable for all of its shots, meanwhile camera 1 came from the bar toasted. Steady Cams and Image stabilization is a <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2vvdJGxPkI">wonderful thing</a>.</p>
