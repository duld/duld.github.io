Git has become the defacto standard<br> to keep track of your code as you develop features and fix bugs. If it's<br> good enough for the Linux kernal and Microsoft's internal<br> code base, it's good enough for you.</p>

                    <h3>Github Pages</h3>
                    <p>The setup process was very straight forward. No problems. It feels a little strange to have such a bare page up lol. I have never used GHPages before but I use GitHub regularly. Although not that regularly since the start of these classes. RIP my commit streaks!</p>
                    <p>So, since using GitHub Pages is new to me I&rsquo;ve did a little reading. There Is a lot of useful information located on here. With further useful links at the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#further-reading">bottom</a>.</p>
                    <p>Some TLDR points about GitHub Pages:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp; Soft 100gb bandwidth limit</li>
                    <li>&nbsp; GitHub Pages source repos have a 1gb size limit</li>
                    <li>&nbsp; GitHub Pages have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour*</li>
                    <li>&nbsp; Any GitHub Pages site is accessible on the internet, even if it&rsquo;s in a private repo</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Project Pages</h4>
                    <p>If you decide to create host some other projects on GitHub you can a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages">GitHub page for that project</a> as well, we aren&rsquo;t limited to a single GitHub page.</p>
                    <p>*because of the build limit, there could be a delay when making changes to your site and having those changes applied to your GitHub Pages site.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Git for your OS</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwyv1-yAp_mVQmRDcXl2THA0WEU/view">git bash version</a></p>
                    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwyv1-yAp_mVeEtuUFNWOUVVY00/view">linux subsystem git version</a></p>
                    <p>I have had Git installed for a few months now through the Git for Windows installer. The Linux Subsystem for windows comes with Git already but it is recommended that, you should not mix git bash with the WSL. Pick one or the other. I like to stick to the WSL&rsquo;s git when I know that I don&rsquo;t need anything on the Windows side, or more specifically I need something from the Linux environment. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll use Git Bash and stick my windows environment. Whats funny is my Ubuntu under WSL is the older version based on 14.04 so my git version is older than my git bash version of git.</p>
                    <p>For learning basic Git commands I think <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbanTh2CoAY">this</a>&nbsp;video is short and to the point and covers many of the most common commands. Except for <strong>git log</strong> and <strong>git diff</strong>. Which are pretty important I, think.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">git diff</a>&nbsp;:&nbsp;a command to show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log">git log</a>&nbsp;:&nbsp;show commit logs, very useful. If you want to checkout an older commit of you will need git log to find the hash associated with the commit.</p>
                    <p>git log --graph : graph where your branches diverged, where you head is at etc. Useful for visualizing your commit history.</p>
                    <p>git log --oneline&nbsp; : show the same output as git log but make the output more terse. Easier to read most of the time</p>
                    <p>There is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">free book on Git</a>&nbsp;which I keep bookmarked on my phone. I've seen other free books as well from but might as well stick to the source.</p>

                    <h3>Clone your Github Repo</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwyv1-yAp_mVSjhoVW94Q3dJaEE/view">results from git log</a></p>
                    <p>Pretty easy. Although I cloned my CIT-93 GitHub repository by habit. I was a little confused for a moment to find a .gitignore already present. Whoops! I would like to mention that if you don't like having to type out the commit message in the command line, it is common to use a simple text editor. You can set which editor to use, by running the command:</p>
                    <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.editor WhateverEditorYouDecideToUse<br /><br /></code></pre>
                    <p>Also, just because you set a default editor doesn't mean you have to use it every single time, it should only launch when you neglect the message flat (-m) when you run your git commit. And finally there has been some serious thought and contemplation about how you should structure your git commit messages. I was a little critical at first but everything I've read on the topic makes sense. I like this explanation from Chris Beams, <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">How to Write a Git Commit Message</a>&nbsp;. Also I do not do everything that he recommends, but I probably should...</p>
