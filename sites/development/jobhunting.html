                    <p><strong>Craigslist</strong><br />&lt;city&gt;.craigslist.org/search/sof<br />I've often heard of people who have trouble finding work through job boards or recruiters, but have luck through craigslist. You can look for openings or advertise yourself. The bad part is that it's city by city. but if you use their drop-down you can work your way down the list. Another con is that sometimes people will post jobs with below minimum wage or just above minimum wage. So be mindful of that, know your value. =)</p>
                    <p><strong>Dice.com</strong><br />keywords : JavaScript, Front-end, web developer<br />Dice is not the greatest if you are looking for work in the central valley. They have better listings around larger tech hubs but if you are not limited to the Central Valley then you should give it a shot. Use state level searching as opposed city, if you want to get any results if your location of interest is not a large city.</p>
                    <p><strong>centralvalleyhelpwanted.com</strong><br />keywords: none<br />catagory: Computer Programming, Internet/Web Design/Social Media<br />This is not a go to site for me very often. But I have found listed jobs on the website that aren't anywhere else. You will have to weed through jobs, that have nothing to do with web developing or computer programming even if you filter by those categories. Can become annoying. Worth checking, monthly? bi-monthly?</p>
                    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs?med=site-ui&amp;ref=jobs-tab">Stack Overflow - Developer Jobs</a><br />keywords: Front End, Web Developer, JavaScript<br />Very similar to Dice, in terms of success for finding work in the central valley. But if you are looking wider, the benefit of Stack Overflow's job board over dice or LinkedIn is that your Stack Overflow profile is easily visible for recruiters to look at. Which might be worthwhile if you have spent time earning internet points on Stack Overflow.</p>
                    <p><strong>List of Job Boards</strong><br />There is an article on <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2015/07/14/job-sites-to-find-your-first-developer-job/">skillcrush.com</a> that has a lot of job searching sites that I had never known about. It's worth a bookmark I think. Or just google Web Developer Jobs and It's one of the top items that will come up. =)</p>
                    <p><strong>What to avoid - experience and what I've heard</strong><br />Avoid any freelance websites that have an open marketplace where firms from other countries can participate. Nothing against anyone outside of the U.S. but the cost of living in many places outside of the U.S. is much lower so they can afford to run what they charge per hour into the ground. And you're not competing with individuals often but entire teams of people.</p>
                    <p>If you're okay with little to no compensation and just gaining the experience, find someone local or nearby that you can build a relationship with. After the work is complete use that contact to write a positive review of your work and post it on your website. Not my idea, I've just heard it repeated over and over again from others.</p>
                    <p>What I found surprising whenever I look for jobs are the huge amount of requirements that get listed for the opening. From what I've heard is that most of those requirements are "wish list", and they are willing to accept individuals who don't meet all the requirements listed but show an ability to learn those skills down the road.&nbsp;</p>
