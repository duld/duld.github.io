                    <p>Free Hosting* -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix.com</a></p>
                    <p>If you have watched an Web Development related videos on YouTube then I'm sure you know about Wix, Grammerly, SquareSpace, Treehouse and whatever else the Ad Algorithms have targeted you with. Wix is a platform that allows you to quickly build a website from a template and then edit it. If you want to build from a nicer template I believe you have to pay. You start off with 500mb of storage and 500mb of bandwidth. So if you have a 500mb website you will be able to serve your website to 1 person, make it count! You can of course increase your bandwidth and storage if you move onto their paid plan.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Paid Cloud Hosting - <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/pricing">SquareSpace</a></p>
                    <p>SquareSpace is a nicer version of Wix. They have some decently sized clients, who I am sure heavily customize their site to not resemble anything from the templates. But like wix you start form templates and build your site. They can handle payments if you want to put up a store, but they charge you 3%.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I am not a huge fan of either of those options. So I searched a little on the WebDev subreddit and found this thread</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6hzp7x/best_web_hosting_whats_your_advice_recommendations/">Best Web Hosting. What's your advice? Recommendations? - June 2017</a></p>
                    <p>I was a little surprised how many people recommended <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/compute/">Digital Ocean</a>. I have heard of Digital Ocean, and everything I've heard has been really good. Suspiciously popular. Conspiratorially one might say... They are very popular for people who want to experiment with a Web App idea but I haven't really heard about their general purpose hosting. I feel like maybe DO might be good for developing your idea and then moving &nbsp;your deployment to a more traditional host, but I really don't know. I'd be very interested. I would want to try them, just to see what the hype is all about personally =).</p>
                    <p>On a side note, this article <a href="https://www.upguard.com/articles/digitalocean-vs-aws">Digital Ocean vs AWS</a> answers some of my questions. $5 a month is their cheapest plan and you can scale it up from there.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>PCmag ranked the more traditional web hosts out there. Users on Reddit (the link above) ripped host gator apart though. But I'll still include the link.</p>
