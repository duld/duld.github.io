                                <p class="bnr-para">With the advent of Web 2.0, the WWW is made up of more than just static sites these days. Web Apps, not <br>just markup and style, but software in their own right have become commonplace on the web. <br>What seperates an Site vs an App?</p>

                    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Site vs App</strong></span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Web Apps</strong>: &nbsp;</span>Google Maps, would be a web App, it&rsquo;s doing LOD image loading based on zoom, fastest route calculation, incorporating traffic into that calculation, giving results for walking, public transportation displaying local business, letting you read reviews on those business, etc. Large shopping websites like Amazon, Target, etc. are web Apps also. My initial intuition would make me think otherwise because they aren&rsquo;t very &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; as say the app we used to edit images online during week 1 of the class. But a lot of tech is being used for a Target.com. There are user accounts, store finder, shopping cart and checkout, site wide search, trending products. Let&rsquo;s hope they are running some extra security when it comes to storing our debit/credit card numbers though. =/</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Website:</strong> Excluding blogs this is, hard for me to pin down. Because so many sites that appear basic have are being built off some database. Reddit for example doesn&rsquo;t seem like there is a lot going on, but it&rsquo;s being dynamically generated off the rating of a post on some board somewhere that&rsquo;s being tracked automatically. And when you make a request to Reddit.com it&rsquo;s making that lookup and returning the ranking of those posts to you. &nbsp;<a href="http://conceptf1.blogspot.ch/2013/11/list-of-freely-available-programming.html">http://conceptf1.blogspot.ch/2013/11/list-of-freely-available-programming.html</a> Is the only website in my bookmarks that I would even consider to be a website, it looks like it&rsquo;s being built from blogger but the actual functionality of the site, that the visitor interacts is very basic.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Build and they will come</strong></span></p>
                    <p>I don&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;<em>serious</em>&rsquo; app ideas. But I was in a Wal-Mart the other day and overheard a Dad stuck in an infinite &ldquo;why?&rdquo; loop with his very young child. I immediately thought of an app that generates a random generic answer to a &ldquo;why?&rdquo; from an unsuspecting child. The response could be as accurate or as nonsensical as you make it, I don&rsquo;t think any young child will really discriminate. If they do then they&rsquo;re probably at an age where you could explain something to the best of your ability and the inquisitive mind might retain it.</p>
                    <p>The App could be open source so anyone could contribute answers, and possible moderate any inappropriate submissions that get through. If enough contributions get made the answers could be categorized so it would be harder to detect that the answers are nonsensical and unrelated. I don&rsquo;t know if this is cruel towards children, my intuition says no, but I should shop it around to actual parents to get their ethical input on this. I hope it would be taken as what it&rsquo;s intended, a silly joke app.</p>
